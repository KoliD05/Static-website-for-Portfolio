---

## About

This project is my first major task during the internship: building a personal portfolio website. The aim is to have a clean, responsive, and informative static site that includes:

- My introduction / about me  
- Education and qualifications  
- Projects I have worked on (with links, descriptions, tech used)  
- Skills & tools I’m familiar with  
- Contact information

- ## Features

- **Responsive Design** — works well on desktop, tablet, mobile  
- **Clean UI / UX** — simple navigation, minimal and professional look  
- **Project Gallery / Section** — ability to showcase multiple projects with details  
- **Education & Timeline** section  
- **Contact Form or Contact Info**  
- **Performance & Accessibility** in mind (fast load, good HTML/CSS structure)  


## Project Structure

Here’s a rough idea how files / folders are organized:

portfolio-website/
├── index.html
├── about.html (or sections in index)
├── projects.html (or sections)
├── education.html (or sections)
├── contact.html (or section)
├── css/
│ └── styles.css
├── js/ (if needed, for interactivity)
├── images/
│ └── project-screenshots, profile pic, etc.
├── assets/
└── README.md
